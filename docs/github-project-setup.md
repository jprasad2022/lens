## Project Board Automation

### GitHub Actions Automation
1. When PR is opened → Move issue to "In Review"
2. When PR is merged → Move issue to "Done"
3. When issue is assigned → Move to "In Progress"
4. When "blocked" label added → Move to "Blocked" column

### Sample GitHub Action for Project Automation
```yaml
name: Project Board Automation

on:
  issues:
    types: [opened, labeled, unlabeled, assigned]
  pull_request:
    types: [opened, closed]

jobs:
  automate-project:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/github-script@v6
        with:
          script: |
            // Automation logic here
            const projectNumber = 1; // Your project number
            
            if (context.eventName === 'issues') {
              if (context.payload.action === 'opened') {
                // Add to backlog
              }
              if (context.payload.action === 'assigned') {
                // Move to in progress
              }
            }
```

### Team Lead Responsibilities
- Triage new issues weekly
- Assign priorities
- Move issues between columns
- Run weekly standup

### Developer Responsibilities

## Metrics to Track

1. **Velocity**: Story points completed per sprint

3. **Bug Rate**: New bugs vs features ratio
4. **Burndown**: Progress toward milestone
