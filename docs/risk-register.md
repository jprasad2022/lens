# Risk Register

## Top 5 Risks and Mitigation Strategies

### 1. Kafka Service Outage
**Probability**: Medium  
**Impact**: High  
**Description**: Kafka cluster becomes unavailable, preventing event streaming and real-time updates.

**Mitigations**:
- Implement circuit breaker pattern with exponential backoff
- Fallback to direct database writes with WAL for later replay
- Cache latest recommendations in Redis with 1-hour TTL
- Use Kafka cluster with multi-AZ deployment
- Set up alerts for consumer lag > 1000 messages

**Contingency Plan**:
- Switch to batch processing mode
- Use cached recommendations
- Queue events locally for replay when Kafka recovers

### 2. Model Serving Latency Spike
**Probability**: High  
**Impact**: Medium  
**Description**: Model inference takes longer than SLO (>800ms P95), degrading user experience.

**Mitigations**:
- Pre-compute top-K recommendations for all users daily
- Implement model quantization to reduce size
- Use GPU instances for complex models
- Cache predictions with user-based TTL
- Implement request timeout at 2 seconds

**Contingency Plan**:
- Automatic fallback to simpler model (popularity)
- Serve cached/pre-computed recommendations
- Reduce K (number of recommendations) dynamically

### 3. Cloud Budget Overrun
**Probability**: Medium  
**Impact**: High  
**Description**: Cloud costs exceed allocated budget due to traffic spikes or inefficient resource usage.

**Mitigations**:
- Set up billing alerts at 50%, 80%, 100% of budget
- Implement resource quotas and limits
- Use spot/preemptible instances for non-critical workloads
- Auto-scale down during low traffic periods
- Regular cost optimization reviews

**Contingency Plan**:
- Immediate notification to team lead
- Reduce number of instances
- Disable non-essential features (A/B testing, extensive logging)
- Switch to free tier services where possible

### 4. Data Drift
**Probability**: High  
**Impact**: Medium  
**Description**: User behavior patterns change significantly, causing model performance degradation.

**Mitigations**:
- Implement drift detection on key features (genre preferences, rating patterns)
- Monitor online metrics (click-through rate, watch time)
- Set up automated retraining pipeline (weekly)
- A/B test new models before full deployment
- Track feature distribution statistics

**Contingency Plan**:
- Trigger immediate model retraining
- Increase weight of recent data
- Fallback to ensemble of multiple models
- Notify data science team for investigation

### 5. Security Breach / API Abuse
**Probability**: Low  
**Impact**: Very High  
**Description**: Unauthorized access to API, data exfiltration, or denial of service attack.

**Mitigations**:
- Implement rate limiting (100 req/min per IP)
- Use API keys for authentication
- Enable CORS with strict origin policy
- Log all requests with anomaly detection
- Regular security audits and dependency updates
- Encrypt sensitive data at rest and in transit

**Contingency Plan**:
- Immediate API key rotation
- Block suspicious IPs
- Enable stricter rate limits
- Switch to authenticated-only mode
- Notify security team and users if data compromised

## Risk Matrix

| Risk | Probability | Impact | Risk Score | Priority |
|------|------------|---------|------------|----------|
| Kafka Outage | Medium | High | 6 | High |
| Model Latency | High | Medium | 6 | High |
| Budget Overrun | Medium | High | 6 | High |
| Data Drift | High | Medium | 6 | High |

## Monitoring and Review

- **Weekly**: Review metrics and early warning indicators
- **Monthly**: Update risk assessments and mitigation strategies
- **Quarterly**: Conduct disaster recovery drills
- **On-incident**: Post-mortem and risk register update

## Escalation Path

1. **On-call engineer**: First responder for all incidents
2. **Team lead**: Budget overruns, security incidents
3. **ML lead**: Model performance issues, data drift
4. **DevOps lead**: Infrastructure and Kafka issues
5. **Project manager**: Cross-team coordination, stakeholder communication
