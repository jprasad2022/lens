## Critical Path

The following tasks are on the critical path and any delays will impact the project timeline:

1. **Week 1-2**: Architecture design (blocks all development)
2. **Week 2-3**: Kafka setup (blocks streaming features)
3. **Week 3-5**: ML pipeline (blocks model development)
4. **Week 4-6**: Core API (blocks frontend integration)
5. **Week 9-10**: Load testing (blocks production deploy)
6. **Week 11-12**: Production deployment (blocks launch)

## Risk Mitigation Schedule

### Week 4: First Integration Test
- Verify all components can communicate
- Identify integration issues early

### Week 8: Mid-project Review
- Assess progress against timeline
- Adjust scope if needed
- Resource reallocation if required

### Week 12: Pre-production Review
- Full system test
- Performance benchmarks
- Security audit results

### Week 14: Go/No-go Decision
- Final readiness assessment
- Launch planning
- Rollback procedures
